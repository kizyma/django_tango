git init - in root project folder
git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/django_tango.git
git add .
git commit -m "Some message" - initial commit message

IN CASE YOU MADE AN OOPSIE

git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories 
git push -f origin master - yeah, I re-wrote remote, cause I am not very good with GIT
git log 

If not, proceed as ususal


Then venv and stuff. You might go the venv route, but in my case I will use Conda + PIP, since it is much, MUCH easier to maintain

conda --version - to make sure conda was installed properly
conda update conda
conda create -n rangoenv python=3.8
conda activate rangoenv
conda deactivate
pip install
